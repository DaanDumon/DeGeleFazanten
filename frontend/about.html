    </h1>
    <p>
        DeGeleFazanten is website that will be selling in-game currency. The website is a project for our Web & mobile class, we're making this as a group project <br>
        to be able to work together with students of different courses since these two courses will be working together in the future too. <br>
        We made this website to be able to buy all sorts of in-game currency for all different types of games in one place. We tried to make this site <br>
        as user friendly as we could. We want to make sure everyone can use our site to buy the in-game currency they want.
